## Introduction

Dino-Run is a fun and interactive game that demonstrates the power of the Flutter framework combined with the Flame game engine. The game is inspired by the classic "no internet" Dino runner game in Chrome, where the player controls a dinosaur and tries to avoid obstacles as it runs faster and faster.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Tap to jump and avoid obstacles.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Endless running with increasing difficulty.
- **Pixel Art Style**: Classic and nostalgic graphics.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs smoothly on Android, iOS, Web, Windows and MacOs devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built entirely using Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Flame**: A lightweight game engine built on top of Flutter, Flame provides all the necessary tools to create 2D games quickly and effectively.
